Sound	Changed sound to not actually call the dos functions 
	sound\nosound and removed the header dos.h

Monitor Is the code called when the home key is pressed

Opcodes	Is just a helper for the print register debug function no changes required

Main	Does nothing out of the ordinary

Address Does nothing which requires changing. But there is room for optimisation

Io_read	 Assumes that the current_key things are setup correctly.

-------------

Scroll	Purely for the graphical scrolling of a screen

Screen	Is the whole graphics system and text system. This should be split into
	two subsystems

Misc	Does a lot of useless stuff like show the startup screen but also
	has the overall initialisation function

IRQ	Does the irq function correctly, but also calls 'getkey'
        This has to setup the keys correctly.

Io_write Trys to change the pallette, flash, update screen and do stuff with
         the cursor.
